TheoryGrabber
==========================
Grabs papers from arxiv and eccc, displayes them nicely and puts them into a local folder.

Howto:
Start with theorygrabber -l <directory> to set up.
Use theorygrabber -c to set as current time.
Wait a couple of days and call theorygrabber without any arguments.
